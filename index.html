        </div>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 16, 2025</p>

            This Privacy Policy describes how Gaurav Act Studio ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application (the "App").
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information in a few different ways to provide and improve our services.</p>

        <h3>Information You Provide Directly</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Booking & Inquiry Information:</strong> When you fill out a booking or inquiry form, we collect personal details such as your <strong>name, phone number, event type, event date, event time, and event address</strong>. We also collect any additional notes or requirements you provide.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>"Your Photos" Request:</strong> When you request photos from a past event, we collect your <strong>name, WhatsApp number, event date, and event type</strong>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Location Information:</strong> With your explicit permission, we access your <strong>coarse location</strong> (e.g., city and state). This is used solely to pre-fill the location field in our booking forms for your convenience. You can disable location services at any time through your device settings.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>App Settings:</strong> We locally store your language preference on your device using SharedPreferences to provide a customized experience. This data is not transmitted off your device.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To process and respond to your booking requests and inquiries.</li>
            <li>To fulfill your requests for photos from past events.</li>
            <li>To communicate with you regarding your requests and our services.</li>
            <li>To personalize your experience by pre-filling form data (location).</li>
            <li>To improve the functionality and user experience of our App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. We do not sell your personal information. We share your data only in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> To handle your booking and photo requests, we use a third-party service called <strong>EmailJS</strong>. The information you submit in our forms (e.g., name, phone, event details) is securely transmitted through EmailJS to be delivered to our internal email address (<a href="mailto:gauravkumarpjt@gmail.com">gauravkumarpjt@gmail.com</a>). This allows us to receive and manage your requests efficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Third-Party Links:</strong> Our App contains links to our social media pages (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp) and to Google Maps. Please be aware that when you click on these links, you are visiting a third-party site with its own privacy policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
            Information you submit through our forms is transmitted to us via the EmailJS service. We store your app preferences, such as language, locally on your device using standard Android features (SharedPreferences). We take reasonable measures to help protect your information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location Permissions:</strong> You can grant or deny access to your device's coarse location at any time through your device's settings menu.</li>
            <li><strong>Providing Information:</strong> You can choose not to provide personal information through our forms, though this may prevent you from making booking or photo requests through the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Our services are not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.
